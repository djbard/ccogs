This suite of tools contains packages for computing cosmological quantities on
the GPU. Details of the calculations themselves and the implementation can
be found in the "CITING_THIS_CODE" file in this directory.

Each package has its own descriptive "README" which can be found in its
subdirectory. In there, you can find the details of each package. 

The packages in the ccogs suite are:

----------------------------------------------
# aperture_mass
----------------------------------------------

This code calculates the aperture mass map for a given dataset. In this code, 
we use the filter proposed by Schirmer et al (2007), which is an NFW profile 
with exponential cut-offs at zero and large radii.


----------------------------------------------
# angular_correlation
----------------------------------------------

This code calculates the 2-pt angular correlation function using data and
a flat distribution of randomly generated galaxies. A particular estimator 
is chosen, but the user has the flexibility to explore other estimators.
